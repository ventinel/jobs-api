Remote team members are used to four to six hours of focused, uninterrupted work every day. You have to be able to get through problems on your own and be productive without asking for help. There’s no substitute for skill and experience in those cases.\"\n\nWe have specific work to be done so can hire quickly. Shopify experience optional but a plus!\n\n### Location\nThis is a fully remote position with frequent travel to the HQ, located in Brussels.",

This changes how you do things.\nWe’re 100% remote: and have been from the beginning. Every decision we’ve made has been based around optimizing our remote operations.\nWe’re all a little weird: and we like it that way. We’re more than just chat avatars; we’ve all gotten to know each other, have grown together, and love working with each other.\nWe enjoy the journey: we’re in this for the long haul. We’re not chasing an exit or the next round of funding. We’re building something we’re proud of and want to keep improving on.\n\n**Learn More**\n* [About this role](https://knack.com/careers/frontend-engineer)\n* About our work culture\n* About Knack",
